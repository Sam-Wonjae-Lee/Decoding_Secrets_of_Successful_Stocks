## **About**


### **Project Goal**

⠀ As an investor, the question is, which stocks are most profitable in the long-term, and what factors contribute to their success? Our team will use a tree data structure to identify the promising factors and the most likely companies to invest in and utilize the backtesting approach to determine the profitability of the investments.

⠀ We aim to determine the most promising stocks for investment by analyzing the correlation between their performance metrics. Based on the analysis, we will rank the stocks using a binary tree to group the stock by ranking for investment. We will then simulate backtesting results based on the conclusions drawn from the correlation analysis and historical data.


### **Motivation**

⠀ One of the reasons for this project is the increase in interest in stocks during and after the pandemic. Many people have turned to invest in stocks to make passive income or grow their savings during a time of economic uncertainty. However, with so many companies to choose from, it can be challenging to know which ones are most likely to provide a good return on investment. By using past datasets, we can analyze historical data, current market trends, and other relevant factors to identify the companies that are confused to perform well in the future. This can help investors make more informed ed decisions about where to put their money and maximize their returns. Another motivation for developing a stock market investment program is the passion of one of our partners, Yehyun Lee for stock market trends. His passion positively affected us and we were also willing to explore the trends along with him.
