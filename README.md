**Your project proposal will be a LaTeX document using this template project\_proposal.tex (right-click and select “Save as…” to download this file to your computer). Your proposal will consist of the following components:**

1. Project title (pick something informative and professional, but you can be creative too) and names of all group members.
1. Brief problem description and project question/goal. (200–400 words)
   1. Give an overview of any background knowledge necessary for the reader to understand the problem you are studying.
   1. Provide context for the problem and motivate why you have chosen your project question/goal.
   1. Your project question/goal should be in bold; it should be fairly concise, but can be more than one sentence.
1. A computational plan for your project. (400–600 words)
   1. Describe what kind of data your project will use to represent your chosen domain.
   1. Clearly explain how you will use trees and/or graphs to model a central part of the data. While your project can certainly use other data types (e.g., sets, lists), trees and/or graphs must play a prominent role in your program.
   1. If your project requires real-world data, provide a source for at least one relevant dataset you have found, and provide some sample data contained inside that dataset.
   1. Describe the kinds of computations you plan to perform, such as: building trees/graphs from a dataset or computation, data transformation/filtering/aggregation, computational models, and/or algorithms.
   1. Your proposed computations can be based on what you’ve done in lectures/tutorials/assignments but should not simply replicate work you’ve already done.
   1. Explain how your program will display or report the results of your computations in a visual and/or interactive way. You don’t need to go into a lot of detail here, but it should be clear what you plan to do
1. A references section that lists the references you used for your proposal. This should include references from your topic research, the reference for where you obtained the dataset, and any online documentation or tutorials for the Python library you plan to use for the project.
   1. You may use any academic reference style you wish, e.g. MLA or IEEE.
   1. See also this Overleaf tutorial on including references in LaTeX. This is optional, but you may find it interesting to dive deeper into LaTeX.
5. Technical requirement: for your project, you must use at least one Python library/module that we have not covered in this course, or use plotly or pygame to a much larger extent than what we have given you so far in this course. (See examples and note in the next section).
   1. In this part of your proposal, you should also describe one new library you intend to use, how you will use it, and why it is appropriate. Refer to specific functions, data types, and/or capabilities of the library that make it relevant for solving the problem you wish to solve. You don’t need to be an expert in this library, but should demonstrate that you’ve done more research into this library than just a quick Google search.
