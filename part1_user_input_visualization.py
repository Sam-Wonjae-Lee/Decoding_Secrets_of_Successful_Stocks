    contribute to their success? Our team will use a tree data structure to identify the promising factors
    and the most likely companies to invest in and utilize the backtesting approach to determine the
    profitability of the investments.""")

    analyzing the correlation between their performance metrics. Based on the analysis, we will rank the stocks
    using a binary tree to group the stock by ranking for investment. We will then simulate backtesting results
    based on the conclusions drawn from the correlation analysis and historical data.""")

    # Text
    st.write("""â €\tOne of the reasons for this project is the increase in interest in stocks during and after the 
    pandemic. Many people have turned to invest in stocks to make passive income or grow their savings during a time of
    economic uncertainty. However, with so many companies to choose from, it can be challenging to know which
    ones are most likely to provide a good return on investment. By using past datasets, we can analyze
    historical data, current market trends, and other relevant factors to identify the companies that are
    confused to perform well in the future. This can help investors make more informed ed decisions about where
    to put their money and maximize their returns. Another motivation for developing a stock market investment
    program is the passion of one of our partners, Yehyun Lee for stock market trends. His passion positively
    affected us and we were also willing to explore the trends along with him.""")
