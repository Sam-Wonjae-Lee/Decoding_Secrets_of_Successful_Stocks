<Announcement>
As I am close to finishing the code, now, I expect everyone to work on overleaf even if we're not on call & even when we're not on code-together.

You can work individually for overleaf, there's no doubt about that.

Use your spare time on overleaf please.

Starting tomorrow I cannot spend too much time on CS assignment due to 3 assignments I have to work on for other courses. At this point, I put sufficient amounts of work on CS, so I will be spending less time on project.

Thus, I want everyone to take responsibility on finishing this CS project even when I am not instructing every details of what to do.

You need to figure out what you need to do to make our project better.

If you are not sure what are next steps & what are things to do, ask me.

Hope for best.

I will be in-person tmr with Hisham and work on CS project.
Cya yall
